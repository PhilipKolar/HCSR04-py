HCSR04-py
=========

Data collector for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, for use with a Raspberry Pi. Should work with all 3 models of the RPi (A, B, B+) but has has only been tested on the model B.

The main script to see here is usonic.py. There are also some other miscellaneous scripts that are unnecessary to the functionality of usonic.py.

This set of scripts was part of the data collection I did for my 2014 Honours project, for which my main suite of programs can be found at https://github.com/PhilipKolar/SensorSuite.
