HCSR04-py
=========

Data collector for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, for use with a Raspberry Pi. Should work with all 3 models of the RPi (A, B, B+) but has has only been tested on the model B.

The main script to see here is usonic.py. There are also some other miscelaneous scripts that are unnecessary to the functionality of usonic.py. The FormatConverter project is a small C# program that was designed to convert data to be used with my main suite of programs (https://github.com/PhilipKolar/SensorSuite) used in my 2014 Honours project
